### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

You've found my work profile, where all my workrelated code is made/posted. Because I work at the awesome workplace of Dagbladet BÃ¸rsen, all of that work is obviously private. So this repository mostly serves the purpose of showing my experience with coding, while my private profile, HHHoegsted, has a few public repositories. Most of these are older repos from my time at school, and are impaired by the fact that they were made while learning.

Hans-Henrik
